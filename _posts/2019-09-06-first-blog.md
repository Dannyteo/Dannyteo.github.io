<p>Finally get to explore the creation of a website within github to put all my projects in one place, after completing project 4 today! One more passion project and we would have completed our 12-week data scientist bootcamp at METIS! So much to catch up in terms of the new knowledge and skills picked up in the past 9 weeks. Overwhelming!</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, I will share all the completed projects here. Just a preview for now:</p>
<ul>Predicting Condominium and Apartment Prices in Singapore</ul>
<ul>Supervised Learning: Which Customer will be leaving in your next Business Cycle?</ul>
<ul>Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Movies into 5 main Genres based on their plots.</ul>
<ul>Passion Project: To be decided soon...</ul>

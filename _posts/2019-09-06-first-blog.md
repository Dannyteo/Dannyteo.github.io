<h1>Danny Teo, the Not-So-Great Data Scientist</h1>

<ul>
<p><font size="5">Finally get to explore the creation of a website within github to put all my projects in one place, after completing project 4 today! </font></p>
  <p><font size="5">It comes a long way! </font></p>
<p><font size="5"> One more passion project and we would have completed our 12-week data scientist bootcamp at METIS!
So much to catch up in terms of the new knowledge and skills picked in the past 9 weeks. Overwhelming!</font></p>
</ul>

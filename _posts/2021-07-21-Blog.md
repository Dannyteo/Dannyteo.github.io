<p>After almost 2 years, I finally revisit this website I created in 2019 when I was attending METIS Data Science Bootcamp. This time round, I am converting it into my professional profile site to be used when I solicit for management consultating and training opportunities.</p>
<p>So far, I had shared it with 3 potential business partners to test for their responses. If it works, I will put in full effort to further enhance the content to cater for a wide audience.</p>

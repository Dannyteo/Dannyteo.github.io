<h1><font color="blue">Data Scientist</h2>
<p>I started to explore data science full-time through METIS Data Science Bootcamp organized by Kaplan Singapore from July to September 2019.
 In 12 weeks, I learned so much in this new area and I realized that there are much more to pursue, so I have decided to treat it as a lifelong 
 hobby moving forward.</p>

Thinking, Cloud Computing, Blockchain and Cybersecurity from March 2021 to September 2021.</p>

<p>I advocate physical activities for all ages to live a life free of diseases and pain, a happy life without the 
need of medication, when you can make exercise your medicine. I am a certified jump rope coach and a Singapore Health 
Promotion Board (HPB) Health Ambassador</p>

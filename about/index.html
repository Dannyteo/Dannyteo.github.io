<h2>As a data scientist</h2>
<p>Born on 31st of January 1967, I only started to explore data science full-time through METIS Data Science Bootcamp
  organized by Kaplan Singapore from July to September 2020.
  In 12 weeks, I learned so much in this new area and I realized that there are much more to pursue, so I have decided
  to treat it as a lifelong hobby moving forward .</p>

<h2>Management consultant</h2>
<p>I want to bring values to my clients to improve their business processes and help them to achieve business
  excellence, and ultimately,
  help them to go for IPO.</p>

<h2>As a teacher/trainer/coach</h2>
<p>I want to develop practical and useful courses for my students/learners to learn and apply in their lives to help
  improve their quality of living.</p>

<h2>As a business owner</h2>
<p>I had run a few businesses previously. To be frank, I don't think I am cut out to be a successful businessman. But, I
  enjoyed the process nonetheless. </p>

<h2>As a husband</h2>
<p>I am married since 1992. How time flies! I want to thank my wife for her understanding in allowing me to take 3
  months without income to pursue my learning in METIS Data Science Bootcamp. </p>
<h2>As a father</h2>
<p> I have 2 grown-up children, a daughter and a son, living with my wife and I.</p>
<h2>As a son</h2>
<p>My mom is 87 years old this year! I hope she will be healthy and live beyond 100 years old to witness her son's
  success and enjoy what I provide for her in terms of material and spiritual support.</p>

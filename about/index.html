<h2>Data scientist</h2>
<p>Born on 31st of January 1967, I only started to explore data science full-time through METIS Data Science Bootcamp
  organized by Kaplan Singapore from July to September 2020.
  In 12 weeks, I learned so much in this new area and I realized that there are much more to pursue, so I have decided
  to treat it as a lifelong hobby moving forward .</p>

<h2>Management consultant</h2>
<p>I want to bring values to my clients to improve their business processes and help them to achieve business
  excellence, and ultimately,
  help them to go for IPO.</p>

<h2>Teacher/trainer/coach</h2>
<p>I want to develop practical and useful courses for my students/learners to learn and apply in their lives to help
  improve their quality of living.</p>

<h2>Business Owner</h2>
<p>I had run a few businesses previously. To be frank, I don't think I am cut out to be a successful businessman. But, I
  enjoyed the process nonetheless. </p>

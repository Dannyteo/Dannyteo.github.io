<h1><font color="blue">Financial Planning</h1>
<p>I believe everyone should set personal financial goals in life. As a CFP/ ChFC/ CLU/ FChFP, I was once an associate lecturer for Nanyang Polytechnic and Entrepreneur Resource Centre (ERC) teaching financial planning courses.
I am helping anyone who is interested to explore their financial status and set goals to achieve financial freedom in the long run.</p>
  
<h1><font color="blue">Sports Coach/ Health Ambassador</h1>
<p>I advocate physical activities for all ages to live a life free of diseases and pain, a happy life without the 
need of medication, when you can make exercise your medicine. I am a certified jump rope coach and a Singapore Health 
Promotion Board (HPB) Health Ambassador</p>

<h1><font color="blue">Web Development</h2>
<p>I picked up web development through Udemy course learning both front-end and back-end. This website was built with the knowledge and skills I learned during this 
online course. I also learned php separately. These self-directed learning courses helped me to realize my dream of building website from scratch. In future, I will share the websites
I built here under "IT Projects".</p>

<h1><font color="blue">Data Science</h2>
<p>I started to explore data science full-time through METIS Data Science Bootcamp organized by Kaplan Singapore from July to September 2019.
In 12 weeks, I learned so much in this new area and I realized that there are much more to pursue, so I have decided to treat it as a lifelong 
hobby moving forward.</p>

<h1><font color="blue">Cybersecurity </h1>
<p>I started to explore cybersecurity through IBM's 6 months cybersecurity program where I got certified as a practitioner in Enterprise Design
Thinking, Cloud Computing, Blockchain and Cybersecurity from March 2021 to September 2021.</p>

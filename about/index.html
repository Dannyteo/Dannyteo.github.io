<h2><font color="blue">Work</font></h2>
<h2>As a data scientist</h2>
<p>Here I am. At 52 yeears old, I started to explore data science full-time through METIS Data Science Bootcamp organized by Kaplan Singapore.
In this 12 weeks, I learned so much in this new area and I realized that there are much more to pursue, so I have decided to treat it as a
long-term "hobby" moving forward.</p>

<h2>As a management consultant</h2>
<p>I want o bring values to my clients to improve their business processes and help them to achieve business excellence.</p>

<h2>As a teacher/trainer/coach</h2>
<p>I want to develop practical and useful courses for my students/learners to learn and apply in their lives to help improve their quality of living.</p>

<h2>As a business owner</h2>
<p>I had run a few businesses previously. To be frank, I don't think I am cut out to be a successful businessman. But, I enjoyed the process nonetheless. </p>

<h2>As a husband</h2>
<p>I am married for 27 years. How time flies! I want to thank my wife for her understanding in allowing me to take 3 months without income
  to pursue my learning in METIS Data Science Bootcamp. </p>
<h2>As a father</h2>
<p> I have 2 grown-up children, a daughter and a son, living with my wife and I.</p>

  what I provide for her in terms of material and spiritual support.</p>
